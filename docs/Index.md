This is a simple MockUp which only provides the Skeleton to run Power Automate Flows locally.

Check out [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) to start writing simple test cases on your Flow or checkout [coming soon](comingSoon.md) to test Common Data Service (Current environment) flows, full featured Mock Up using [XrmMockup](https://github.com/delegateas/XrmMockup),

### Advanced tests

There is no example on advanced tests yet. Browse [coming soon](comingSoon.md) to see how I have used PowerAutomateMockUp to implement a full featured CDS connector test for flows.
