## Getting Started

This is a my bachelor project and thus not yet ready to be used in production.

This project, Power Automate Mockup, is based as a base mock, a skeleton, which only provide the core functions used in Power Automate flows. It is meant to be extended to provide a fully mock for every action in a connector or just the action you want to use. Take a look at [PAMU_CDS](https://github.com/thygesteffensen/PAMU_CDS) to see how I have used this mock, to mock the Common Data Service (current environment) connector and how I have used [XrmMockup](https://github.com/delegateas/XrmMockup) to do this.
